# EncryptionForKids

Encryption for kids is a program designed to teach kids about encryption.
The Three modes include Encryption, Decrpytion, and Color Selection.

<h2>
Encryption
</h2>
Encryption allows a student to paint a scene, house, or whatever they like on a canvas. Then, once they are finished, can encrypt the painting into a matrix of color values,
where white is "000", red is "001", blue is "010", green is "011", and yellow is "100". 
<h2>
Decryption
</h2>
Decyrption allows students to go from the text to the painting.
<h2>
Color Selection
</h2>
The color selection allows users to set what colors they can use in the painting process.
