# EncryptionForKids

Encryption for kids is a program designed to teach kids about encryption.
The Three modes include Encryption, Decrpytion, and Puzzles.

<h2>
Encryption
</h2>
Encryption allows a student to paint a scene, house, or whatever they like on a canvas. Then, once they are finished, can encrypt the painting into a matrix of color values,
where white is "000", red is "001", blue is "010", green is "011", and yellow is "100". 
<h2>
Decryption
</h2>
Decyrption allows students to go from the text to the painting.
<h2>
Puzzles
</h2>
Puzzles are where students are challenged to solve encryptions! Students must either start from the text values and create the painting or go from the painting to the text
value.
